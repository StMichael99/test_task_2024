# Welcome!

## Introduction

Hello dear participant,

We greatly appreciate your interest in our company and our working processes. To ensure a successful onboarding experience, we have outlined the steps you need to follow:

## Onboarding Steps

1. **Complete Tasks**: The tasks required for onboarding are located [here](task.ipynb). This section is divided into two parts:

    a. **Familiarize Yourself with Basic Indicators**: In this part, you are expected to become acquainted with basic indicators that can describe market sentiment or direction. You should build proposed indicators (or your own) and plot them on one chart with the price. You are free to choose any coin, symbol, or asset, as well as the time period (one month or one year). After plotting, describe the chart with your thoughts. (Note: Please refrain from using ChatGPT during this task.)

    b. **Reproduce Trading Strategy of Top Bots**: This part is more complex and demanding. You are tasked with reproducing the trading strategy of top bots. The end result should be a chart showing cumulative realized profit and the distribution of profit (mean, minimum, maximum, count, quartiles: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75). You may also choose to split your long positions and short positions onto different charts. PS. Do not forget anout fees: market order - 0.022%, limit order - 0.004%. 

2. **Technical Interview with Team Members**

3. **Operational Interview with CEO**

Please follow these steps diligently to ensure a smooth onboarding process. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us.

We look forward to having you on board!
